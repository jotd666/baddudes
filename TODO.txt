- second player: some missing frames
  compare new "player" frames list to the original one, original
  probably missing cases as we didn't go further with p2
- quantize shifts for bosses: not correct anymore for level 3 boss at least
- karnov level 6 and 7: wrong colors, palette probably changes slightly between levels
  maybe a per-level dump would fix the issue
  (old:  mutant karnov black color issue: conflict between truck tires and mutant karnov on palette 9
  BUT fixing karnov steals too many colors and now character trousers are not all white...)

- jump on long or double joystick press? It would help playing with a one button joystick.
- level 2: climbers on the right "blink" (frame/grouping?)
- infinite lives cheat doesn't work
- maybe we can add 2 player mode now that memory dropped drastically
- check parallax with new technique ; Sprite Configuration (SSCAN2 (bit 15), 64-bit AGA Sprites)
SPRITE_MODE     EQU          (1<<15)+(%1100) so position the trees on the left
first see that there's a gap then set the sprite mode

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- is there enough memory to mirror all sprites? in which case blitter chain interrupt
  would maybe enhance the game speed
- boss 5: locomotive wheels erase wrong
- level 7: fix president/door colors / boss 7: bad color change
- game over: credits screen corruption, high score corruption at the end of demo too
  also?? tests test_input_bit_d1 (0x0174c,0x0175c,0x07e66), then goes back to menu but intro screen trashed
- level 1 repair front objects (status bar showing but destroyed, debug this)
  => control word for multiplexed after lamp is not working but other sprites are also destroyed!
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)
- isolate tree at level 4 detect when player/enemies is in that zone (absolute X/Y coords maybe)
  and blit the tree over the player/enemies (there are 2 locations). Maybe it can be done
  with the grass too.
  
LOWER PRIORITY:
- game over: check if music plays
- level 3: missing splash sounds
- level 1: generate 16 shifted grid plane masks to apply to a fastmem copy of the truck mask
  that we'd use dynamically when the truck appears
- easy: identify devil pole spin sound id
- level 1 when ninjas arrive on truck, truck & ninjas on it slightly drift
- helicopter at the end: president sprites & door shifted (cycle exact)  
- level 6: stalactite wrong colors (used to be OK)
- level 5: red girls missing frames
- end sequence should use scrolling sprites for credits: allocate huge 2x high sprite buffers
- save/load highscores
- knife sound has blow+man scream (hack not working there... maybe we could see if player
  has weapon... not working in 2P mode though)
 
- bosses 2, 5, 6: rework sheets to change white by some other color that doesn't
  conflict with main character (0xEEE => ????) so dynamic color change works fully
  also: palette 2 seems to fit most bosses (level 5 & 6) much better (except that outfit is blue
  instead of green)

- level 7-2: sabreman (actually any generic ninja) can happen between devil pole & dragonninja:
  play without invincibility and wait for blows...


low priority:

- 2nd player could be rendered with top = first player top tiles and bottom: tiles with
  changed plane order (trial and error to get acceptable colors) to save memory
- flashing "insert coin": missing first "I" which corrupts bottom left OSDs
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it
- level 7: missing heli sound but would steal 1 music channel...
- invincibility: still hit when falling on road; pits (level 2): 
  game must not change p1_state_flags_00ffa386 must remain to 0x10
- compare US & japan ROMS see what are the differences: there are A LOT!
- if TOTAL_CHIP_MEMORY_SIZE = 1250000, train level loads but background is trashed
  and memory manager doesn't detect any issue...
- still not restored black color ex: tile 4ae/02 (sword level 5)
- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 5: map tiles & fix the buggy inverted tiles
- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$22  || D0==$21 || D0==$20 || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- skip all but one sound: bpset 0df2a,D0!=$2F,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- log sounds: bpset 0df2a,,{printf "%x",D0;g}
