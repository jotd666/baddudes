- easy: dump sprites with quantized colors too (to be able to find colors to change
  on dynamic color load)
- easy: merge baddudes log from level 1 to level 2
- reduce truck size to test
- check truck x pos shift vs ninjas on it: wrong
- tune bltafwm from a value in zp
- sometimes tile restore goes crazy better seen on main character X < 0 (in karnov)
  now X<0 main character still not displayed (AGAIN!!)
- level 3 to make a video!
- level 2 purple boss red: => should dynamically change it when boss appears like in the game, maybe hook
     on the set palette:
	 ex: load_boss_2_purple_colors_0102c if write to 3103E0 with A1 = 0x0117c+rom_base
	 then load level 2 boss palette
	 
- group cars bobs to display them in 1 piece (if possible, as it requires clipping)
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER)
- easy: when losing a life, life character is not erased
- regression: truck missing 1 bitplane or something... wrong color
- level 2 truck: rip & clip lower wheel parts as they'll be placated with wheel sprites
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it

- hack lamps/trees/fire hydrants (from 244000 layer) with hardware sprites:
  figure out first layer row scroll registers, "trigger" tile to display / undisplay sprite
  => get scroll value from 242404 write (set_front_layer_scroll_0e3f0)
- missing frames: karnov head when dying,
  main character with nunchuck upper tiles (crouching, 0x30,0x32 still not dumped or displayed)
- karnov: when scrolling at 0, characters on fence upper
  left "wrap" to bottom right tile restore is wrong
- truck: X-clipping creates strange artifacts (jailbars) 
  depending on shifting (mask???) also start of truck bltafwm not working
- need to optimize truck/train erase: depending on the level, compute the parts that need
  background refresh. Truck: bottom (wheels) + part between front & tow & exhaust pipe. 
  Rest: not needed. same for big truck & train, with inter-tow: in progress

  
- use wrap for vertical scrolling (level 7)?? or just make display faded black until
  scroll is right again
- level 4 backgruond trees: get image: then use static 3 color sprite image with 3 greens
  or 3 browns with dynamic color change, use sprites 4-7 with priority: behind playfields
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 6 background cave maybe OK with 3 grays
- sprite mirror_planes: mirroring with width != 16 to implement: test on 32 then make a special case for 32 bits (d0=6)
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- better bob group erase (not just 2 by 2 but full, would be handy to erase
  cars if sprites aren't grouped)

- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles

- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies

- "bad dudes" title still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted


- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music level 1: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}

reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
