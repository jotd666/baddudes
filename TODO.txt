- implement sprites, test it first on game intro screen (glasses...)
  * fully implement sprite system
  * hack palette carefully so ninjas (red/blue/grey) only use 5*3 colors together
  * hack palette carefully so bad dudes trouser colors are located on powers of 2 to save
    memory duplication (2 player mode)
  * log used sprites for various levels
  * possible context change on some given X/Y (rounded) scroll values to load/unload sprites (boss fights)
    or just patch the game at 00eca (initialize boss)
  * patch display_multi_tile_object_028c6 to include special cases where
    object is fully displayed (no multi-tile shit), ex ninjas, create extended sprite codes
	for those cases, cars: whole block
	
- write letters: should "cookie cut": generate tiles mask too, fix palette
- rip a few sounds  
- rip more 244000 tiles (for demo)
- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles
- scrolling!!! 
- access fault FFFF894D at 18E44 after a while: use HH and trace A0 change:
- access fault  1952e read from FFFFxxxx !!! debug MAME



- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- figure a way to free the last block? OR store block at some point in intro to avoid
  reloading 244000 tiles OR keep 244000 tiles loaded at all times
  (and share palette with 24D000 layer too!)

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- tileset 04: fake black but also some tiles with actual black, identify them in the converter
  to generate a modified tile_04
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU



reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
