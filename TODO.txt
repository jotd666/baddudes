- truck jailbars when simpler blit with no source and BLTBDAT=0 in some cases?????
  => OK with actual zero source WTF!!!
- missing frames player attacking with dagger check again?
- sometimes modulo issue with second level truck
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work)
- easy: T truck key should stop the game control of the scrolling
- truck blit erase issue (front of truck), truck right clip part too soon

- karnov/in general when scrolling at 0, existing screen buffer is slightly trashed:
  with restored tiles: add debug key to toggle screen with/without 
  scroll / check when the sprite draw is avoided and see what values it would yield
- multiplex sprites 4 to 7 to do (lower hud): ATM only one object is displayed at a time

- easy: dump sprites with quantized colors too (to be able to find colors to change
  on dynamic color load)

- level 3 to make a video! needs to log 24dxxx tiles and load them
- level 2 purple boss red: => should dynamically change it when boss appears like in the game, maybe hook
     on the set palette:
	 ex: load_boss_2_purple_colors_0102c if write to 3103E0 with A1 = 0x0117c+rom_base
	 then load level 2 boss palette

- FPS options: full 50, 25, adaptative (depending on number of enemies)	 
- level complete messages should use front object sprites
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER)
- level 2 truck: clip lower wheel parts as they'll be placated with wheel sprites, clip exhaust too!!
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it

- need to optimize truck/train erase: depending on the level, compute the parts that need
  background refresh. Truck: bottom (wheels) + part between front & tow & exhaust pipe. 
  Rest: not needed. same for big truck & train, with inter-tow: in progress

  
- use wrap for vertical scrolling (level 7)?? or just make display faded black until
  scroll is right again
- level 4 backgruond trees: get image: then use static 3 color sprite image with 3 greens
  or 3 browns with dynamic color change, use sprites 4-7 with priority: behind playfields
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 6 background cave maybe OK with 3 grays
- sprite mirror_planes: mirroring with width != 16 to implement: test on 32 then make a special case for 32 bits (d0=6)
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- better bob group erase (not just 2 by 2 but full, would be handy to erase
  cars if sprites aren't grouped)
- group cars bobs to display them in 1 piece (if possible, as it requires clipping), 
  which is definitely possible & easy: create a fake 48-high tile made from various car stripes: would divide number of blits by 2

- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles

- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies

- "bad dudes" title still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted


- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music level 1: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
