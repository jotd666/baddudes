- mockup game sprites from a sprite memory capture at game start (display dude!)
- implement sprites
  * fully implement sprite system
  * possible context change on some given X/Y (rounded) scroll values to load/unload sprites (boss fights)
    or just patch the game at 00eca (initialize boss)
  * patch display_multi_tile_object_028c6 to include special cases where
    object is fully displayed (no multi-tile shit), ex ninjas, create extended sprite codes
	for those cases, cars: whole block
  * to save memory, log used tiles per level (ex: no climbing ninjas in non-truck/train levels, no cars,
    on the other hand, no gray sabre men on truck, or dogs), flipping/flaming ninjas only
	on levels 4 (and 6?)

- still undetected real black on enemies (Karnov...) OK on Bad dude.
  
- tile/sprite set: if not used, put 0 and don't dump empty clut list with only zeroes!
	
- rip a few sounds  
- rip more 244000 tiles (for demo)
- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles
- scrolling!!! 

- if possible, hack lamps/trees/fire hydrants (from 244000 layer) with hardware sprites

- write letters: should "cookie cut": generate tiles mask too, fix "bad dudes" 
  almost OK, still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- figure a way to free the last block? OR store block at some point in intro to avoid
  reloading 244000 tiles OR keep 244000 tiles loaded at all times
  (and share palette with 24D000 layer too!)

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU



reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
