- level 7 vertical scrolling "trick": fails for "scroll down" completely
  * optim: don't blit 3x horizontally, use 2x width then 1x width, optimally around the
    displayed screen (as the game will draw the tiles furter than that)
  could probably be optimized to only restore the buffers partially, not the whole width
- background restore: complete wrapping (line 332 "now the second restore blit, wrapped around")  
- general sprite position / scroll problem
  - level 2 wheels shifted
  - level 1 when ninjas arrive on truck, truck & ninjas on it drift
  - when swapping half screens (level 6 and 7), can be shifted too
  - this is still not 100% reproducible
- same as above: y scroll level 6 first Y scroll doesn't scroll up to 0x60, stops at 5C/5D: debug on real machine??
  possibly mid-screen interrupt issue?? (happens when scolling horiz. If not moving character
  it's OK!!)
- easy: branch to copper change sky on those screens
  copjmp2 contains copper color change + load copjmp1 return + copjmp1
  blue: 123, 159, 195 => 79C, 79D to merge to 1 color
- group erase: not good enough: make a table to macro objects (by patching the original game)
  and their size. Only issue: re-figure out the X/Y display coords. Major advantage:
  group erase works horizontally/vertically without any other computation
- easy: boss energy bar missing right half
  
- still missing sprites on level 2, possibly others...
- easy: mutant karnov black color issue
- stalactite wrong colors (used to be OK)
- color change doesn't work on level 7 boss rush (because color downscaling ends up with
  different colors than the one in previous levels)
- should do a per-level symmetry on spidermen, red ninjas, green ninjas, dogs...
  to continue for higher levels 3,4,5,6,7
- boss 5: locomotive wheel erase wrong
- level 5: remainer of wagons showing when gap erasing not effective on edges

- do a OPT_TWO_PLAYER_MODE option, ideally it would rule to have 2 versions of the game
- on game over, tests test_input_bit_d1 (0x0174c,0x0175c,0x07e66), then goes back to menu but intro screen trashed
- level 5: red girls missing frames?
- truck 2: sprites & truck shifted in the end???
- level 4: punching enemies while kneeled: missing frame? happens on other levels too
- level 1 repair front objects (status bar showing but destroyed, debug this)
  => control word for multiplexed after lamp is not working but other sprites are also destroyed!
- tune autoframeskip: force 2 skips for train/truck levels all the time
  remain auto 0-2 for other levels
- level 2: climbers on the right "blink" (frame/grouping? wrong clipping?)
- easy: track boss 7 color change
- ending sequence trashed/flashes... double buffering vs simple buffering?
- easy: missing second screen sequence sprites (president+bad dudes)
- end sequence should use scrolling sprites for credits: allocate huge 2x high sprite buffers
  first find a way to reach sequence faster
- boss rush: a lot of bosses have wrong colors: reset colors before replacing palette
  (boss 2 => boss 3 in level 7): done: to test
 
	
- 2nd level complete in a row "STAGE X CLEAR" "G" remains from previous "go to next stage"
- difficulty level what does it do? maybe using "easy" would reduce number of enemies
  and make game smoother?? boss energy is lower on low difficulty (which the port gets
  by default!)
- level 7 display helicopter!
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)
- save/load highscores
- end music has issues with ptplayer, also tune start is wrong
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it
- leave demo running: level 3 but with status bar trashed (because of 2P life), 2P mode with player 2 invisible
- demo running: when inserting coin, suddenly needs 2 coins for 1 credit...
- knife sound has blow+man scream (hack not working there... maybe we could see if player
  has weapon... not working in 2P mode though)
 
- drop 2 player mode, use rightmost OSD sprite for real parallax in levels 4 and 6
  see if we can blit the score afterwards if 2P mode is reinstated, anyway 2P mode is
  a problem as it uses 4 more colors and it degrades sprite palette even further.



low priority:

- invincibility: still hit when falling on road (level 2): 
  game must not change p1_state_flags_00ffa386 must remain to 0x10

- middle lower OSD missing timeout char on "CONTINUE"
- level 3 demo: game uses 2 players
- if TOTAL_CHIP_MEMORY_SIZE = 1250000, train level loads but background is trashed
  and memory manager doesn't detect any issue...
- still not restored black color ex: tile 4ae/02 (sword level 5)
- bosses 2 and 5: rework sheets to change white by some other color that doesn't
  conflict with main character (0xEEE => ????) so dynamic color change works fully
- restore buffer memory size optimize:
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*3*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2
could be
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*2*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2

- restore clip on max scroll (around 0x300) too strict (no restore!), probably same for clear, debug TMPWRITE

- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 5: map tiles & fix the buggy inverted tiles
- level 6: same
- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$22  || D0==$21 || D0==$20 || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- skip all but one sound: bpset 0df2a,D0!=$2F,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- log sounds: bpset 0df2a,,{printf "%x",D0;g}
