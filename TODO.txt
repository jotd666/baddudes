collect unpatched memory references > 0x80000 < 0xFFxxx ram and display/log them


- load highscore palette, why is layer not erased 244000 ?? watchpoints!
- figure a way to free the last block? OR store block at some point in intro to avoid
  reloading 244000 tiles OR keep 244000 tiles loaded at all times
  (and share palette with 24D000 layer too!)

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- copy_memory_to_tiles_0837c: should be 1FF, reduced to FF to avoid trashed gfx
- tileset 04: fake black but also some tiles with actual black, identify them in the converter
  to generate a modified tile_04
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU



reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
