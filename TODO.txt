Hi,

I'm making good progress on Bad Dudes vs Dragonninja. There's an amiga version which has some okay music but

- it's incomplete
- the instruments used may be okay or very shitty (ST-00...)

The tunes are available as MP3 or vgmrip: https://vgmrips.net/packs/pack/bad-dudes-vs-dragonninja-data-east

Could you try to create close versions of the tunes, maybe using some instruments of the amiga modules? The tunes would use 3 channels, except for the
"game completed" tune which can use all 4 channels.

I'm expecting a "big" hit so I'd share a good percentage of the donations with you.

Not sure that all tunes could fit in one module. Level 1 and level 2 could use separate modules if instruments are too different, in order to save chipmem.
As opposed as other smaller games, I'm using files & per-level loading or I couldn't make it happen with 2MB chip. ATM code is 300Kb in chipmem, and since the game
needs fastmem, those 300k could easily contain the tunes if the exe was relocated.

- sprite priorities vs planes: on top
- sprite palette: starts at color 64
- multiplexed sprites for scores / lamps / status
- still undetected real black on enemies (Karnov...) (almost) OK on Bad dude.
- IN PROGRESS: sommersault frames look inverted / Karnov too. Mockup with Karnov
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- hack lamps/trees/fire hydrants (from 244000 layer) with hardware sprites:
  figure out first layer row scroll registers, "trigger" tile to display / undisplay sprite
- ninja truck display would work using just 8 colors with 3 planes and try to make a fake ghost effect
  with the bars... Palette would need to be rearranged with truck colors first...
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- blit big object partially (truck, train...)
- sprite display: skip displaying is done too soon on left
- sprite mirror_planes: mirroring with width != 16 to implement: test on 32 then make a special case for 32 bits (d0=6)
  
- use wrap for vertical scrolling (level 7)
- level 4 backgruond trees: get image: then use static 3 color sprite image with 3 greens
  or 3 browns with dynamic color change, use sprites 4-7 with priority: behind playfields
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 6 background cave maybe OK with 3 grays


- rip a missing sounds  
- rip more 244000 tiles (for demo)
- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles

- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- optim with restore_background or clear_fg_planes...: if blitter if busy,
  use the cpu to process that plane

- "bad dudes" title still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- figure a way to free the last block? OR store block at some point in intro to avoid
  reloading 244000 tiles OR keep 244000 tiles loaded at all times
  (and share palette with 24D000 layer too!)

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU

- skip music level 1: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F,{CURPC=$13DA;g}

reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
