- truck jailbars when simpler blit with no source and BLTBDAT=0 in some cases?????
  => OK with actual zero source is minterm right???
- try to display truck 1 times out of 2??? see effect? try not to display animated wheels

- optim: create fake 32 bit wide groups for car & truck wheels (level 2) to save blitter time
- optim: dump sprites when car is displayed to see if group erase is easily doable with more than 1 group

- remove BB9 BB8 BBA BBB (glasses) from log (old artifact)
- level 2 missing frames player attacking with dagger check again? also player flames
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work)
- truck blit erase issue (front of truck), truck right clip part too soon
 
- karnov feet erase issue, doesn't seem to be erased (also true for jumping ninjas) probably
  group erase not working
- karnov/in general when scrolling at 0, existing screen buffer is slightly trashed:
  with restored tiles: add debug key to toggle screen with/without 
  scroll / check when the sprite draw is avoided and see what values it would yield
- multiplex sprites 4 to 7 to do (lower hud): ATM only one object is displayed at a time

- level 2: copper shade yellow/white (24 bit preferably)
- level 2: remove blue colors for tiles 7F 76 77 (collect the colors), replace by existing, same for scrolling road, then
  restore them using copper, which will also leave more colors for the rest
- level 2: group cars bobs to display them in 1 piece (if possible, as it requires clipping), 
  which is definitely possible & easy: create a fake 48-high tile made from various car stripes: would divide number of blits by 2

- easy ?? level 2 purple boss red: => should dynamically change it when boss appears like in the game, maybe hook
     on the set palette:
	 ex: load_boss_2_purple_colors_0102c if write to 3103E0 with A1 = 0x0117c+rom_base
	 then load level 2 boss palette: to test

- FPS options: full 50, 25, adaptative (depending on number of enemies)	 
- level complete messages should use front object sprites
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER), middle lower OSD also missing 1 char
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it

- need to optimize truck/train erase: depending on the level, compute the parts that need
  background refresh. Truck: bottom (wheels) + part between front & tow & exhaust pipe. 
  Rest: not needed. same for big truck & train, with inter-tow: in progress

  
- use wrap for vertical scrolling (level 7)?? or just make display faded black until
  scroll is right again
- level 4 backgruond trees: get image: then use static 3 color sprite image with 3 greens
  or 3 browns with dynamic color change, use sprites 4-7 with priority: behind playfields
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 6 background cave maybe OK with 3 grays
- sprite mirror_planes: mirroring with width != 16 to implement: test on 32 then make a special case for 32 bits (d0=6)
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem




low/not reproduced


- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies

- "bad dudes" title still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted


- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music level 1: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
