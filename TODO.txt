find:

collect unpatched memory references > 0x80000 < 0xFFxxx ram and display/log them

- delete "rampant ninja" text not working properly (1 out of 2 erased, debug with MAME)
- when tile 5/526 is written at 244398, blit dude 0
- when tile 5/41E is written at 244398, blit dude 1
- produce dude file in "data" and allocate/load it

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- copy_memory_to_tiles_0837c: should be 1FF, reduced to FF to avoid trashed gfx

  use osd_set_tile_context or such to reset tile logger & load another tileset
- tileset 04: fake black but also some tiles with actual black, identify them in the converter
  to generate a modified tile_04
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU

encode 244000 layer as main title & characters use it


reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
