- level 6 regenerate sprites (player killed not displayed??)
- level 6: player killed on wrap boundary still issues, check sprite
  clipping
- new clipping limit (to fix clipped porsche on left) seems to have
  side effects (incorrect left clip for ninjas...)
- karnov killed missing body (try with karnov_dead mockup!)
- easy: second screen sequence sprites (president+bad dudes)
- first ending sequence picture is ghosted...
- end sequence should use scrolling sprites for credits: allocate huge 2x high sprite buffers
  first find a way to reach sequence faster

- train: rebuild pic, see if can be loaded!
  

- level 2 truck display: gaps not always cleared, bottom not properly erased,
  end of truck not properly erased: debug line 1130 with black instead of restore
  starts all right (get the values) but at some point it loses sync with the gap
  
- cars in level 2 still parts not displayed at times...

- crash at the end of level 1 => level 2 (other levels switch OK!): front object conflict

- level 7 vertical scrolling "trick": if y scroll gets > 0x100, then
  * blit restore buffer from y=0x100 to 0x200 in 0
  * set y_extra_scroll_offset at -0x100
  then if y scroll gets <= 0x100 do the same thing in reverse
  (optim: clear all "to delete" objects when doing the full restore)
  
  * works for "scroll up" (1st time) but restore background fails on lower Y (planes destroyed)
    besides off-screen tiles seem wrong
  * fails for "scroll down" completely
  
  could probably be optimized to only restore the buffers partially, not the whole width
  
  * temporary: just clear the playfield, see what the game does around with tiles draw
    and restore
	
- level 6 vertical y wrap completely off (screen copy is wrong, screen restore is OK)

- elevator door tiles: missing black: a80-ab6 pal 0e: maybe get proper palette
  directly in sheet as it's wrong... at the animal fight (else palette is wrong)
- background restore: complete wrapping (line 2760)  

- difficulty level what does it do? maybe using "easy" would reduce number of enemies
  and make game smoother??
- boss 6 & 7 wrong grouping / missing tiles  
- level 7 display helicopter!

- level 5,6,7: karnov wrong colors, maybe paste direct proper colors like level 4 boss
  palette 9 burgundy trousers, green skin
- repair front objects (will destroy status bar)
- 2nd button doesn't seem to work
- autoframeskip not tuned properly
- level 2: no lamps if objects 2 loaded. Ok if objects 1 loaded
- drop 2 player mode, use rightmost OSD sprite for real parallax in levels 4 and 6
  see if we can blit the score afterwards if 2P mode is reinstated
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)
- save/load highscores
  
  
- truck jailbars when simpler blit with no source and BLTBDAT=0 in some cases?????
  => OK with actual zero source is minterm right???


- remove BB9 BB8 BBA BBB (glasses) from log (old artifact)
- truck blit erase issue (front of truck)
 
- karnov feet erase issue, doesn't seem to be erased (also true for jumping ninjas) probably
  group erase not working. Same for level 6 devil pole
- multiplex sprites 4 to 7 to do (lower hud): ATM only one object is displayed at a time


- optim: group erase on 16 (working) or 32 bit wide blocks


- boss 5 color change
- boss 6 color change
- boss 7 color change

- rip train pic if possible (to avoid special treatment)
- level complete messages should use front object sprites (sprites 4-7, unload backgrounds first
  in levels 4 and 6)
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER/"P"USH BUTTON), middle lower OSD also missing 1 char
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it
- need to optimize truck/train erase: depending on the level, compute the parts that need
  background refresh. Truck: bottom (wheels) + part between front & tow & exhaust pipe. 
  Rest: not needed. same for big truck & train, with inter-tow: in progress





low priority:

- reinstate erase grouping when karnov & devil pole feet erase issues are fixed
- debug TMPWRITE when clearing/restoring background, seems to have improved
  some erase artifacts, but still not 100%
- restore buffer memory size optimize:
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*3*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2
could be
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*2*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2

- restore clip on max scroll (around 0x300) too strict (no restore!), probably same for clear, debug TMPWRITE

- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
- invincibility: still hit when falling on road (level 2)
- "bad dudes" title still small glitches (in "BAD DUDES" title)
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- level 3: quantize seems to quantize up to 15 colors not 16. 1 color wasted
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$22  || D0==$21 || D0==$20 || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- log sounds: bpset 0df2a,,{printf "%x",D0;g}
