- jailbars because wrong mask on last zeroed plane. Why?????? removing 1 plane fixes it but
  background is showing... (train)
- ask help on EAB on blitting modes!
- offset issue in train: first wagon not displayed, check D6 x offset vs total width
- train gap should be 8 pixels left (round wagon corners)
- truck/train jailbars when simpler blit with no source and BLTBDAT=0 in some cases?????
  => OK with actual zero source is minterm right???
- level 5: lateral shift issue (off by one wagon), also road scroll trashed (trashes lower OSD sprites)
- level 5: specific erase, specific draw of top of last wagon (to save useless blitting of top of wagons)
- level 1 repair front objects (status bar showing but destroyed, debug this)
- level 2 lots of background trashing - related to truck?
  level 2 when jumping at start, seems that restore is partial
- level 2 wheels black is gone again! same for level 2 boss
- level 6 regenerate sprites (player killed not displayed??)
- level 6: player killed on wrap boundary still issues, check sprite
  clipping
- new clipping limit (to fix clipped porsche on left) seems to have
  side effects (incorrect left clip for ninjas...)
- karnov killed missing body (try with karnov_dead mockup!)
- easy: second screen sequence sprites (president+bad dudes)
- first ending sequence: letters trash the pic (6 planes = limit case?) around line 1660
- end sequence should use scrolling sprites for credits: allocate huge 2x high sprite buffers
  first find a way to reach sequence faster

- boss rush: a lot of bosses have wrong colors: reset colors before replacing palette
  (boss 2 => boss 3 in level 7)
  
  
- cars in level 2 still parts not displayed at times...

- crash at the end of level 1 => level 2 (other levels switch OK!): front object conflict

- level 7 vertical scrolling "trick": if y scroll gets > 0x100, then
  * blit restore buffer from y=0x100 to 0x200 in 0
  * set y_extra_scroll_offset at -0x100
  then if y scroll gets <= 0x100 do the same thing in reverse
  (optim: clear all "to delete" objects when doing the full restore)
  
  * works for "scroll up" (1st time) but restore background fails on lower Y (planes destroyed)
    besides off-screen tiles seem wrong
  * fails for "scroll down" completely
  * try just clearing the buffers to see what is restored properly
  * don't blit 3x horizontally, use 2x width then 1x width, optimally around the
    displayed screen (as the game will draw the tiles furter than that)
  could probably be optimized to only restore the buffers partially, not the whole width
  
  * temporary: just clear the playfield, see what the game does around with tiles draw
    and restore
	
- level 6 vertical y wrap completely off (screen copy is wrong, screen restore is OK)

- background restore: complete wrapping (line 2760)  

- difficulty level what does it do? maybe using "easy" would reduce number of enemies
  and make game smoother??
- boss 6 & 7 wrong grouping / missing tiles  
- level 7 display helicopter!

- 2nd button doesn't seem to work
- autoframeskip not tuned properly
- level 2: no lamps if objects 2 loaded. Ok if objects 1 loaded
- drop 2 player mode, use rightmost OSD sprite for real parallax in levels 4 and 6
  see if we can blit the score afterwards if 2P mode is reinstated
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)
- save/load highscores
  
  


- remove BB9 BB8 BBA BBB (glasses) from log (old artifact)
- truck blit erase issue (front of truck)
 
- karnov feet erase issue, doesn't seem to be erased (also true for jumping ninjas) probably
  group erase not working. Same for level 6 devil pole
- multiplex sprites 4 to 7 to do (lower hud): ATM only one object is displayed at a time


- optim: group erase on 16 (working) or 32 bit wide blocks


- boss 5 color change
- boss 6 color change
- boss 7 color change

- rip train pic if possible (to avoid special treatment)
- level complete messages should use front object sprites (sprites 4-7, unload backgrounds first
  in levels 4 and 6)
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER/"P"USH BUTTON), middle lower OSD also missing 1 char
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it
- need to optimize truck/train erase: depending on the level, compute the parts that need
  background refresh. Truck: bottom (wheels) + part between front & tow & exhaust pipe. 
  Rest: not needed. same for big truck & train, with inter-tow: in progress





low priority:

- reinstate erase grouping when karnov & devil pole feet erase issues are fixed
- debug TMPWRITE when clearing/restoring background, seems to have improved
  some erase artifacts, but still not 100%
- restore buffer memory size optimize:
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*3*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2
could be
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*2*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2

- restore clip on max scroll (around 0x300) too strict (no restore!), probably same for clear, debug TMPWRITE

- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
- invincibility: still hit when falling on road (level 2)
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- level 3: quantize seems to quantize up to 15 colors not 16. 1 color wasted
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$22  || D0==$21 || D0==$20 || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- log sounds: bpset 0df2a,,{printf "%x",D0;g}
