- end music has issues with ptplayer
- level 5: third leg for boss... erase issue again with grouping??
- train erase: remove bottom erase, extend gap to full train height, add erase on the right of the front wheel: saves blitter
  
- levels 1 and 2: use restore_gap for gaps too, calibrate properly with same techniques as
  in level 5
- level 1: truck destroys scenery and has blitter bugs when arriving, also maybe make it 16 colors
- level 1 repair front objects (status bar showing but destroyed, debug this)
- level 2 lots of background trashing - related to truck?
  level 2 when jumping at start, seems that background restore is partial
- level 6 regenerate sprites (player killed not displayed??)
- karnov killed missing body (try with karnov_dead mockup!)
- easy: second screen sequence sprites (president+bad dudes)
- end sequence should use scrolling sprites for credits: allocate huge 2x high sprite buffers
  first find a way to reach sequence faster

- boss rush: a lot of bosses have wrong colors: reset colors before replacing palette
  (boss 2 => boss 3 in level 7)
  
- key to kill player: no lives, 1 energy, to test game over

- crash at the end of level 1 => level 2 (other levels switch OK!): front object conflict

- level 7 vertical scrolling "trick": if y scroll gets > 0x100, then
  * blit restore buffer from y=0x100 to 0x200 in 0
  * set y_extra_scroll_offset at -0x100
  then if y scroll gets <= 0x100 do the same thing in reverse
  (optim: clear all "to delete" objects when doing the full restore)
  
  * works for "scroll up" (1st time) but restore background fails on lower Y (planes destroyed)
    besides off-screen tiles seem wrong
  * fails for "scroll down" completely
  * try just clearing the buffers to see what is restored properly
  * don't blit 3x horizontally, use 2x width then 1x width, optimally around the
    displayed screen (as the game will draw the tiles furter than that)
  could probably be optimized to only restore the buffers partially, not the whole width
  
  * temporary: just clear the playfield, see what the game does around with tiles draw
    and restore
	
- level 6 vertical y wrap completely off (screen copy is wrong, screen restore is OK)

- background restore: complete wrapping (line 2760)  

- difficulty level what does it do? maybe using "easy" would reduce number of enemies
  and make game smoother?? boss energy is lower on low difficulty (which the port gets
  by default!)
- boss 6 & 7 wrong grouping / missing tiles  
- level 7 display helicopter!

- 2nd button doesn't seem to work
- autoframeskip not tuned properly
- level 2: no lamps if objects 2 loaded. Ok if objects 1 loaded
- drop 2 player mode, use rightmost OSD sprite for real parallax in levels 4 and 6
  see if we can blit the score afterwards if 2P mode is reinstated, anyway 2P mode is probably
  not possible given the short memory we have
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)
- save/load highscores
  
  


- remove BB9 BB8 BBA BBB (glasses) from log (old artifact)
- truck blit erase issue (front of truck)
 
- karnov feet erase issue, doesn't seem to be erased (also true for jumping ninjas) probably
  group erase not working. Same for level 6 devil pole
- multiplex sprites 4 to 7 to do (lower hud): ATM only one object is displayed at a time
- invincibility: still hit when falling on road (level 2)


- optim: group erase on 16 (working) or 32 bit wide blocks


- boss 6 color change
- boss 7 color change

- level complete messages should use front object sprites (sprites 4-7, unload backgrounds first
  in levels 4 and 6)
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER/"P"USH BUTTON), middle lower OSD also missing 1 char
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it


- leave demo running: level 3 but with status bar trashed, 2P mode with player 2 invisible
  and when inserting coin, no graphics switch (probably missing set context to go to intro)




low priority:

- if too much memory: optional sounds load per level (boss 3,4 sounds, dogs...)
- still not restored black color ex: tile 4ae/02 (sword level 5)
- bosses 2 and 5: rework sheets to change white by some other color that doesn't
  conflict with main character (0xEEE => ????) so dynamic color change works fully
- restore buffer memory size optimize:
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*3*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2
could be
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*2*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2

- restore clip on max scroll (around 0x300) too strict (no restore!), probably same for clear, debug TMPWRITE

- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- level 3: quantize seems to quantize up to 15 colors not 16. 1 color wasted
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$22  || D0==$21 || D0==$20 || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- log sounds: bpset 0df2a,,{printf "%x",D0;g}
