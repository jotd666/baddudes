- animal yell sound: not played
- on game over, tests test_input_bit_d1, then goes back to menu but intro screen trashed
- level 5: red girls missing frames?
- level 4: punching enemies while kneeled: missing frame?
- level 1 repair front objects (status bar showing but destroyed, debug this)
  => control word for multiplexed after lamp is not working but other sprites are also destroyed!
- boss energy bar missing right half
- level 2 queue trailer erase inefficient when reaching extreme left
- 2nd level complete in a row "STAGE X CLEAR" "G" remains from previous "go to next stage"
- tune autoframeskip: force 2 skips for train/truck levels all the time
  remain auto 0-2 for other levels
- level 2: climbers on the right "blink" (frame/grouping? wrong clipping?)
- test feet for level 6 devil pole, 5 akaikage, maybe fixed???
- easy: track boss 7 color change
- train erase: extend gap to full train height, add erase on the right of the front wheel: saves blitter
  still wagon not deleted properly at times
- ending sequence trashed/flashes... double buffering vs simple buffering?
- level 1 use restore_gap for gaps: seems that clear_fg_planes_any_blitter_internal doesn't work!!
- 'S' debug mode should display varying data on sprite debug locations
  => number of enemies/blits, last unknown played sound?- capture "game over" music: for that we need a high score!
- easy: second screen sequence sprites (president+bad dudes)
- end sequence should use scrolling sprites for credits: allocate huge 2x high sprite buffers
  first find a way to reach sequence faster
- boss rush: a lot of bosses have wrong colors: reset colors before replacing palette
  (boss 2 => boss 3 in level 7): done: to test
- separate copperlist for ending screen: much simpler, and with 24 bit copper sky
  maybe use that copperlist for intro screen too (gray copper sky). When loading tiles & sprite
  palettes, load into both copperlists
- level 7 vertical scrolling "trick": if y scroll gets > 0x100, then
  * blit restore buffer from y=0x100 to 0x200 in 0
  * set y_extra_scroll_offset at -0x100
  then if y scroll gets <= 0x100 do the same thing in reverse
  (optim: clear all "to delete" objects when doing the full restore)
  
  * works for "scroll up" (1st time) but restore background fails on lower Y (planes destroyed)
    besides off-screen tiles seem wrong
  * fails for "scroll down" completely
  * try just clearing the buffers to see what is restored properly
  * don't blit 3x horizontally, use 2x width then 1x width, optimally around the
    displayed screen (as the game will draw the tiles furter than that)
  could probably be optimized to only restore the buffers partially, not the whole width
  
  * temporary: just clear the playfield, see what the game does around with tiles draw
    and restore
	
- level 6 vertical y wrap completely off (screen copy is wrong, screen restore is OK)
- background restore: complete wrapping (line 2760)  
- difficulty level what does it do? maybe using "easy" would reduce number of enemies
  and make game smoother?? boss energy is lower on low difficulty (which the port gets
  by default!)
- boss 6 & 7 wrong grouping / missing tiles  
- level 7 display helicopter!
- level 2: no lamps if objects 2 loaded. Ok if objects 1 loaded
- drop 2 player mode, use rightmost OSD sprite for real parallax in levels 4 and 6
  see if we can blit the score afterwards if 2P mode is reinstated, anyway 2P mode is probably
  not possible given the short memory we have
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)
- save/load highscores
- end music has issues with ptplayer, also tune start is wrong
- optim: group erase on 16 (working) or 32 bit wide blocks
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it
- leave demo running: level 3 but with status bar trashed (because of 2P life), 2P mode with player 2 invisible
- demo running: when inserting coin, suddenly needs 2 coins for 1 credit...
- knife sound has blow+man scream (hack not working there... maybe we could see if player
  has weapon... not working in 2P mode though)



low priority:

- invincibility: still hit when falling on road (level 2): 
  game must not change p1_state_flags_00ffa386 must remain to 0x10

- middle lower OSD missing timeout char on "CONTINUE"
- level 3 demo: game uses 2 players
- if TOTAL_CHIP_MEMORY_SIZE = 1250000, train level loads but background is trashed
  and memory manager doesn't detect any issue...
- still not restored black color ex: tile 4ae/02 (sword level 5)
- bosses 2 and 5: rework sheets to change white by some other color that doesn't
  conflict with main character (0xEEE => ????) so dynamic color change works fully
- restore buffer memory size optimize:
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*3*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2
could be
RESTORE_SCREEN_PLANE_SIZE = NB_BYTES_PER_SCREEN_ROW*2*NB_PLAYFIELD_LINES*2

- restore clip on max scroll (around 0x300) too strict (no restore!), probably same for clear, debug TMPWRITE

- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 5: map tiles & fix the buggy inverted tiles
- level 6: same
- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies
- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$22  || D0==$21 || D0==$20 || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
- log sounds: bpset 0df2a,,{printf "%x",D0;g}
