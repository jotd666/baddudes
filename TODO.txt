find:

collect unpatched memory references > 0x80000 < 0xFFxxx ram and display/log them


- doesnt break at 9592 anymore (to collect highscore context)
- breaks at 1A70 ???? trace with H
- figure a way to free the last block? OR store block at some point in intro to avoid
  reloading 244000 tiles

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- copy_memory_to_tiles_0837c: should be 1FF, reduced to FF to avoid trashed gfx
- tileset 04: fake black but also some tiles with actual black, identify them in the converter
  to generate a modified tile_04
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU
encode 244000 layer as main title & characters use it


reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
