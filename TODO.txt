collect unpatched memory references > 0x80000 < 0xFFxxx ram and display/log them

- implement sprites, test it first on game intro screen (glasses...)
- write letters: should "cookie cut": generate tiles mask too, fix palette
- rip a few sounds  
- rip more 244000 tiles (for demo)
- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles
- scrolling!!! 
- in-game: focus on write a given tile see where it renders, is there a problem with scroll,
  write address, whatever
  
- write to 24A000 => dispatch tiles in 4 quadrants 0 => 0x800
0-200   400-600
200-400 600-800
so NB_BYTES_PER_PF_ROW = 64

- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted
- crash: 1952e read from FFFFxxxx !!! debug MAME
- figure a way to free the last block? OR store block at some point in intro to avoid
  reloading 244000 tiles OR keep 244000 tiles loaded at all times
  (and share palette with 24D000 layer too!)

- osd_write_byte not working properly
- copy_memory_to_tiles_0837c: should be 1FF, reduced to FF to avoid trashed gfx
- tileset 04: fake black but also some tiles with actual black, identify them in the converter
  to generate a modified tile_04
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU



reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
