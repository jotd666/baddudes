- autoframeskip not limited
- quantize loop: count the colors with RGB4 rounding to get more colors!!
- priority of sprites: https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?p=1731201#post1731201
- scroll debug: add Y scroll in the available rightmost 000
- front objects: bottom pixels are trashed
- level 2: no lamps if objects 2 loaded. Ok if objects 1 loaded
- level 2 front object (lamp) not displaying (used to work with level 1 objects)

- level 7 should set an offset for vertical scrolling
- check symmetry for 64 bit wide

- bitplane fmode 3 would it work?
- level 3: water scroll tiles wrong placement, maybe quadrant shit is different than
  for other mode??? dump 24A000 memory on second write to 246010 MAME/amiga and compare
- level 3: put water scroll in some other buffer (allocate one?) so changing plans automatically
  clips the sprites without any other side effect
  
- truck jailbars when simpler blit with no source and BLTBDAT=0 in some cases?????
  => OK with actual zero source is minterm right???

- use audio mixer (optional): https://powerprograms.nl/resources/audio_mixer_v3_6_docs.html#combining

- remove BB9 BB8 BBA BBB (glasses) from log (old artifact)
- truck blit erase issue (front of truck), truck right clip part too soon
 
- karnov feet erase issue, doesn't seem to be erased (also true for jumping ninjas) probably
  group erase not working
- karnov/in general when scrolling at 0, existing screen buffer is slightly trashed:
  with restored tiles: add debug key to toggle screen with/without 
  scroll / check when the sprite draw is avoided and see what values it would yield
- multiplex sprites 4 to 7 to do (lower hud): ATM only one object is displayed at a time


- optim: group erase on 16 (working) or 32 bit wide blocks

- boss 2 color change wrong colors...
- boss 3 color change
- boss 4 color change
- boss 5 color change
- boss 6 color change

- level complete messages should use front object sprites
- left osd mssing 1 char ("G"AME OVER), middle lower OSD also missing 1 char
- log & rip missing sounds: breakpoint on sound not found so able to go to mame and rip it
- use roondar's mixing engine (optional?)
- need to optimize truck/train erase: depending on the level, compute the parts that need
  background refresh. Truck: bottom (wheels) + part between front & tow & exhaust pipe. 
  Rest: not needed. same for big truck & train, with inter-tow: in progress

- level 3: quantize seems to quantize up to 15 colors not 16. 1 color wasted
  
- use wrap for vertical scrolling (level 7)?? or just make display faded black until
  scroll is right again
- level 4 backgruond trees: get image: then use static 3 color sprite image with 3 greens
  or 3 browns with dynamic color change, use sprites 4-7 with priority: behind playfields
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 6 background cave maybe OK with 3 grays
- sprite mirror_planes: mirroring with width != 16 to implement: test on 32 then make a special case for 32 bits (d0=6)
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem




low/not reproduced


- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies

- "bad dudes" title still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted


- osd_write_byte not working properly

howto:
- skip music level 1: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F || D0==$27 || D0 == $2C || D0 == $26,{CURPC=$13DA;g}
