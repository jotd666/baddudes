Hi,

I'm making good progress on Bad Dudes vs Dragonninja. There's an amiga version which has some okay music but

- it's incomplete
- the instruments used may be okay or very shitty (ST-00...)

The tunes are available as MP3 or vgmrip: https://vgmrips.net/packs/pack/bad-dudes-vs-dragonninja-data-east

Could you try to create close versions of the tunes, maybe using some instruments of the amiga modules? The tunes would use 3 channels, except for the
"game completed" tune which can use all 4 channels.

I'm expecting a "big" hit so I'd share a good percentage of the donations with you.

Not sure that all tunes could fit in one module. Level 1 and level 2 could use separate modules if instruments are too different, in order to save chipmem.
As opposed as other smaller games, I'm using files & per-level loading or I couldn't make it happen with 2MB chip. ATM code is 300Kb in chipmem, and since the game
needs fastmem, those 300k could easily contain the tunes if the exe was relocated.

- IN PROGRESS: sommersault frames look inverted / Karnov too. Mockup with Karnov
- ninja wrong early X right clip
- truck: X-clipping creates strange artifacts depending on shifting (mask???), log shifting
  when blitting truck
- implement start level to try to start level 2
- bottom osd: overwritten tiles! ("IF" of 1-life, memwatch where 0x63 char is written, see which blank
  deletes it)
- boss energy needs a sprite too, currently writes into player 1 energy
- multiplexed sprites for scores / lamps / status
- save memory: load truck first then copy in unused chip bitplanes
- still undetected real black on enemies (Karnov...) (almost) OK on Bad dude.
- hack lamps/trees/fire hydrants (from 244000 layer) with hardware sprites:
  figure out first layer row scroll registers, "trigger" tile to display / undisplay sprite
- levels with trains/trucks: load traintrucks bitplanes in non-displayed screen buffer
  to save chipmem
- sprite mirror_planes: mirroring with width != 16 to implement: test on 32 then make a special case for 32 bits (d0=6)
  
- use wrap for vertical scrolling (level 7) or use blitter for vertical scrollling!!!
- level 4 backgruond trees: get image: then use static 3 color sprite image with 3 greens
  or 3 browns with dynamic color change, use sprites 4-7 with priority: behind playfields
- level 4: maybe remove foreground trees if possible
- level 6: same
- level 6 background cave maybe OK with 3 grays


- rip a missing sounds  
- rip 24D000 & 24A000 tiles

- restore buffer uses 3 horizontal playfields, they should use only 2 plus a few tiles
  to restore bobs that "wrap"
  alternative: if bob X + width wrap, clip it and perform 2 restores (but 2x as blits!)
- optim with restore_background or clear_fg_planes...: if blitter if busy,
  use the cpu to process that plane
- quantize should be improved: definitely consider color weights/frequencies

- "bad dudes" title still small glitches
- "CREDIT" not written when coin inserted


- ninja truck display try to make a fake ghost effect with the bars (we'd need bars mask)
- osd_write_byte not working properly
- maybe blit 16x16 tiles at some point instead of using CPU

howto:
- skip music level 1: bpset 0df2a,D0==$1F,{CURPC=$13DA;g}

reverse lb_024dc
reverse jump tables (like in pooyan): get dc.l  lb_xxxxx and set breakpoints
