This port is special because it's not a transcode. It's running using the original 68000
code of the arcade game, with a lot of patches to redirect graphical & sound operations to
the amiga side.

- PAL A1200/A4000 with fast memory
- whdload installed
- 2 button joystick (keyboard also supported)

Keys:

arrows: directions
ctrl: action
alt: jump
1: start game
5: insert coin
