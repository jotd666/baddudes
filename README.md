# baddudes
port of "Bad Dudes vs Dragonninja" (c) 1988 Data East on amiga AGA

Credits:

- JOTD: reverse engineering amiga port, graphics conversion
- no9: music tracks and sound remastering
- Data East: original code, sounds, music & graphics

This port is special because it's not a transcode. It's running using the original 68000
code of the arcade game, with a lot of patches to redirect graphical & sound operations to
the amiga side.

Requirements:

- PAL A1200/A4000 with fast memory
- whdload installed
- 2 button joystick (keyboard also supported)
