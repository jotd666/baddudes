sheets dumped at various moments of the game, where palette is modified for a given character

we use that data to replace the sprites in the sheets (fortunately the original colors aren't used)

This is an alternative to dynamic color change, which is tedious and can sometimes lead to color conflicts
because of color reduction. Besides sometimes close colors already exist in the palette (ex: animal grays & pink)
